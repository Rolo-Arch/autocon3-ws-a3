**Workshop:** WS-A3 — *Network App Development: Design, Deploy, & Automate*  
**Event:** [Autocon3 — May 26, 2025](https://networkautomation.forum/autocon3)  
**Audience:** Intermediate technical level (network engineers, DevOps, automation practitioners)

## 🧰 What You'll Need

To follow the labs during the session, you have two setup options: **GitHub Codespaces (recommended)** or **Local Deployment**. Please review the requirements below and ensure your environment is ready before the workshop.

---

## 🔁 Option 1: GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

Codespaces allows you to run the full lab environment in your browser — no installation required.

### ✅ Requirements:
- A **personal GitHub account**  
- Sufficient **GitHub Codespaces credits** for at least **4 hours** of usage  
- A modern **web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

### 🧩 Optional:
- **Local VS Code installation** (not required, but useful if you prefer working outside the browser)
- VS Code extensions (see below under Local Deployment)

---

## 🖥️ Option 2: Local Deployment

If you prefer to run everything on your local machine, make sure the following tools are installed and working properly.

### ✅ Required Tools:
- [**Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)  
- [**Docker Desktop**](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (or an equivalent container runtime)

### 🧩 Required VS Code Extensions:
- [**Remote - SSH**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)  
- [**Dev Containers**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

---

## 📦 Additional Notes

- Internet connectivity is required throughout the workshop  
- Familiarity with basic Docker and Git Operations is helpful  
- If using local Docker, ensure it is allowed to allocate enough resources (16GB RAM, 4 vCPU)
